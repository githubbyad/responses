____Email not received__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Hi,

Third party emails such as AOL, Yahoo, Gmail etc. constantly change their email policies and as a result, such emails may not be delivered. 

For example, if you have xyz@aol.com under "Forms" screen, bulletlink server will compose email "FROM: xyz@aol.com" and going to "TO: your client email". This email may not be delivered as "FROM: xyz@aol.com" is coming from bulletlink servers as compared to AOL servers. 

We recommend you use your domain related emails such as editor@YourSite.com etc. to avoid submission issues.  Please go ahead and change the AOL, Yahoo or Gmail email to your own email that is associated with your site such as editor@YourSite.com under "Forms" screen.

Thank you.
