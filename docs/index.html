<b>Email not received</b>


Hi,

Third party emails such as AOL, Yahoo, Gmail etc. constantly change their email policies and as a result, such emails may not be delivered. 

For example, if you have xyz@aol.com under "Forms" screen, bulletlink server will compose email "FROM: xyz@aol.com" and going to "TO: your client email". This email may not be delivered as "FROM: xyz@aol.com" is coming from bulletlink servers as compared to AOL servers. 

We recommend you use your domain related emails such as editor@YourSite.com etc. to avoid submission issues.  Please go ahead and change the AOL, Yahoo or Gmail email to your own email that is associated with your site such as editor@YourSite.com under "Forms" screen.

Thank you.

<b>Template Change</b>


Hi,

Your current template and template#  XXX are two different template layout. However, the Site Manager is the same for all our templates. So when you decide to change the template, the following are the items that you should be aware of.

1. Contents from your current template will automatically be transferred onto the new template.

2. Look and feel (theme, color, fonts) everything will be the same as the new template.  Of course, you can still change them later with the help of 24x7 support staff.

3. You will have to resize all ads (images, widgets, etc.).

4. After we convert your site onto a new template, it will look distorted until you resize all images.

NOTE:  This process could take a few hours. If you'd like, we can start this process during night time.

Please confirm that you have read the above and would like us to proceed further with the new template.

Thank you.

<b>Login TimeOut</b>


Hi,

For security and performance reasons, we have set 20-minute time-out limit. If there is no activity in Site Manager for more than 20 minutes, you will be prompted to login again.

Avoid using the browser back button or backspace from the keyboard. Instead, use the back button on top from the "Site Manager" screen itself.

NOTE: We suggest you draft your articles into Notepad or Wordpad and paste it into the "Body" field of "Articles" screen.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Thank you.


<b>PageDesigner issue</b>


Hi,

When using PageDesigner, you need to save pages every 40 minutes else you will get timeout error 500.

To avoid error or losing work on PageDesigner, here are the alternate solutions:

1. If you are going to take a longer time to design pages using PageDesigner, do not click on "submit". Instead, after finalizing your layout/design in PageDesigner (you can take all day without "submit"), click on HTML icon/tab and copy the HTML code. Open new browser tab and log on to Site Manager.  Directly paste this HTML code in the Body of the article without going to PageDesigner.

2. Could you try other browsers such as Firefox, IE or Chrome?

3. Could you try on a different machine?

4. Did you install any plug-ins such as "Grammarly" on your browser? If so, please disable that as it is conflicting with PageDesigner and may create this error issue.

5. We have two PageDesigners to choose from. Try other PageDesigner and see if that works better for you.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Thank you.
